#Main Purposed of this program will be to allow me to loop through text files and evaluate them,
#When its done I should be able to prompt for;
#                                             1.) How many times a word is used
#                                             2.) How many words total
#                                             3.) Ratio of promt words used to compared to other words
#                                             4.) Pass output of Program into text file for later reference

#You're off to a good start by keeping track of the number of instances (how_many) and intending to build context around each occurrence. Letâ€™s refine your approach a bit:
#
#You'll want to ensure you're slicing the list correctly; word in your loop currently doesn't give you the position of the word.
#
#Consider using the index of each occurrence to help with slicing.
#
#You don't need to append the word itself to context, but rather the words surrounding it.
#
#Here's a hint on how to approach these steps:
#
#As you loop over just_words, you can utilize enumerate to get both the index and the word.
#
#When you find the input_word, calculate the start and end indices for your context slice. Consider using max and min functions to stay within the list's bounds.
#
#What do you think would be necessary to implement these suggestions?
